    "This notebook is for implementing a Monte-Carlo reinforcement learning method on the Frozen Lake environment offered through a Gymnasium environment. Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, through the use of a standardized API. There are four key functions to Gymnasium, namely: ```make()```, ```Env.reset()```, ```Env.step()```, and ```Env.render()```.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per its [introductory documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/introduction/basic_usage/), the core of Gymnasium lies in the high-level Python class ```Env```, which approximately represents a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from reinforcement learning theory. This class allows users of Gymnasium to start new episodes, take actions, and visualize the agent's current state. "
