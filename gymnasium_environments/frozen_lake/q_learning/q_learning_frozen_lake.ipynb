    "This notebook is for implementing the base Q-Learning algorithm for off-policy control. Similar to other implementations, this will be done using the Frozen Lake environment offered through Gymnasium. Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, through the use of a standardized API. The ``Env`` class in leveraged within Gymnasium to encapsulate an environment and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) that runs behind the scenes."
